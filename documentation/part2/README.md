### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to expose students to opportunities and solutions around them that are naturally difficult to find and then building a strong community around that. Some of the ways the project is solving this problem is by:

- Providing them with great job offers of different kinds.
- Creating a platform for them to showcase a particular skill which allows them to get clients who would want to patronize them and then vice versa.
- Having a forum for questions and answer about topics really related to students.
